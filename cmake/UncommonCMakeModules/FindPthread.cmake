# Find the Pthreads library
# Works on Linux and Win64 in cross-build environments.
# Provides the Pthread::Pthread imported target to link against which
# can provided IMPORTED_LOCATION properties which are not modified on the linker command line
# like like a simple aboslute path in PTHREAD_LIBRARY variable would be.  This functionality
# is mainly necessary for cross-builds on linux where pthreads is possibly found in a non-standard
# location relative to the CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH.
